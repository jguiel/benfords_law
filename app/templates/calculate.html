<h2>Determine Goodness of Fit</h2>

<p>
    Upload your file below to calculate how well your data fit to this law. Ensure your data have no missing cells; the software is built to skip NaN and none cells, only utilizing integers/floats. Column names are irrelevant; you must include the column number (one-indexed) that contains the data you would like to have analyzed. For example, these data below in column 6 are to be analyzed. The user would input 6, attach the file, and hit submit. The example below was submitted with an error in column titles, so the first value of 8.40188 will be skipped.
